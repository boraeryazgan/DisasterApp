        Hello, I'm Bora Eryazgan, a Computer Science Engineering student at AcÄ±badem University. As an AI enthusiast, I have developed a machine learning project focused on Natural Disaster Detection.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project utilizes TensorFlow's deep learning model to predict whether a given sentence is related to a natural disaster or not. The model has been trained on a large dataset of disaster-related text data, allowing it to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Natural Disaster Detection project combines the power of machine learning and web development. It leverages Flask, a Python web framework, to provide a user-friendly interface where users can enter a sentence and get real-time predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about exploring the potential of artificial intelligence and its applications in various domains. This project is a testament to my dedication to learning and implementing advanced technologies.
